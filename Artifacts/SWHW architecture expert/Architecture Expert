A systems architect is a technology professional who develops and implements computer systems and networks for an organization, defining the earchitecture of a system in order to fulfill certain requirements.
An qualified architecture expert should :
（1）.	be able to decide which architecture supports the quality requirements best
（2）.	know how to best introduce and use model-based development towards quality and consistency
（3）.	get the best use of UML and SysML
（4）.	always try to most efficiently introduce a modeling tool
Remember that an insufficient architecture design can severely impact the subsequent quality and maintainability. An expert is expected to get in hands-on experiences with system-, software-, hardware- and mechanical development.
